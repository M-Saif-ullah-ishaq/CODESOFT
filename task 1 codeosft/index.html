            <h2>About Allama Iqbal</h2>
            <p>
                Allama Iqbal was a philosopher, poet, and politician in British India who is widely regarded
                as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is considered one of the most important figures
                in Urdu literature, with literary work in both Urdu and Persian.

                Iqbal is best known for his poetic works, which include "Lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Ban Ke Tamanna Meri"
                and "Tarana-e-Milli." His poetry, deeply rooted in spirituality and philosophy, has left a lasting
                impact on the cultural and intellectual history of the Indian subcontinent.

                Born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, British India (now in Pakistan), Iqbal's contributions
                extend beyond literature to include his role in the political sphere, advocating for the rights
                of Muslims and envisioning the creation of an independent Muslim state.
